function snr_val = snr(map_init, map_noisy)
%SNR Compute the SNR between two maps
%   Usage snr_val = snr(map_init, map_noisy) 
% 
%   Input parameters:
%         map_init : initial signal
%         map_recon: noisy signal
%   Output parameters:
%         snr_val  : snr
%
%   computes the SNR between the maps map_init
%   and map_noisy. The SNR is computed as:
%
%       10  log10( var(map_init) / var(map_init-map_noisy) )
%
%   where var stands for the matlab built-in function that computes the
%   variance.
