function [ L ] = laplacian_op( I )
%LAPLACIAN_OP 2 dimentional Laplacian
%   Usage:  [I] = laplacian_op( I );
%
%   Input parameters:
%         I     : Input image 
%
%   Output parameters:
%         I     : Laplacian
%
%   Compute the sum of the laplacian along x and y. This operator is
%   self-adjoint.
%
%           L = I_xx + I_yy
