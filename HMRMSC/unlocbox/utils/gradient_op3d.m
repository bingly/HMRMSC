function [dx, dy, dz] = gradient_op3d(I, wx, wy, wz)
%GRADIENT_OP3D 3 Dimentional gradient operator
%   Usage:  [dx, dy, dz] = gradient_op3d(I)
%           [dx, dy, dz] = gradient_op3d(I, wx, wy, wz)
%
%   Input parameters:
%         I     : Input data 
%         wx    : Weights along x
%         wy    : Weights along y
%         wz    : Weights along z
%
%   Output parameters:
%         dx    : Gradient along x
%         dy    : Gradient along y
%         dz    : Gradient along z
%
%   Compute the 3-dimentional gradient of I. If the input I has 4
%   dimentions. This function will compute the gradient of all cubes and
%   return 3 4-dimentionals signals
