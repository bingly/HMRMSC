function y = norm_tv(I,wx,wy)
%NORM_TV 2 Dimentional TV norm
%   Usage:  y = norm_tv(x);
%           y = norm_tv(I,wx,wy);
%
%   Input parameters:
%         I     : Input data 
%         wx    : Weights along x
%         wy    : Weights along y
%   Output parameters:
%         y     : Norm
%
%   Compute the 2-dimentional TV norm of I. If the input I is a cube. This
%   function will compute the norm of all image and return a vector of
%   norms.
