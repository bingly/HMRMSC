function y = norm_tv4d(u,wx, wy, wz, wt)
%NORM_TV4D 4 Dimentional TV norm
%   Usage:  y = norm_tv4d(x)
%           y = norm_tv4d(x, wx, wy, wz, wt )
%
%   Input parameters:
%         x     : Input data (3 dimentional matrix)
%         wx    : Weights along x
%         wy    : Weights along y
%         wz    : Weights along z
%         wt    : Weights along t
%
%   Output parameters:
%         y   : Norm
%
%   Compute the 4-dimentional TV norm of x. If the input I is a 5
%   dimentional signal. This function will compute the norm of all 4
%   dimentional cubes and return a vector of norms.
