function data = twospirals(N, degrees, start, noise)
% Generate "two spirals" dataset with N instances.
% degrees controls the length of the spirals
% start determines how far from the origin the spirals start, in degrees
% noise displaces the instances from the spiral. 
%  0 is no noise, at 1 the spirals will start overlapping
