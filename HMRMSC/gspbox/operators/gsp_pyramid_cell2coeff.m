function coeff = gsp_pyramid_cell2coeff(ca,pe)
%GSP_PYRAMID_CELL2COEFF Cell array to vector transform for the pyramid
%   Usage: coeff = gsp_pyramid_cell2coeff(ca,pe);
%
%   Input parameters:
%       ca      : Cell array with the coarse approximation at each level
%       pe      : Cell array with the prediction errors at each level
%   Output parameters:
%       coeff   : Vector of coefficient
%
%   This function compress the cell array ca and pe into a single
%   vector of coefficients. It keeps  the smaller coarse approximation and
%   the prediction errors. 
%
%   Example:
%
%           [ca,pe] = gsp_pyramid_analysis(Gs, f);
%           coeff = gsp_pyramid_cell2coeff(ca,pe);
