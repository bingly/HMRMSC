%GSP_DEMO Tutorial on the GSPBox
% 
%   In this demo, we are going to show the basic operations of the GSPBox.
%   To lauch the toolbox, just go into the repository where the GSPBox was
%   extracted and type:
%
%           gsp_start;
%
%   A banner will popup telling you that everything happens correctly. To
%   speedup some processing, you might want to compile some mexfile. Refer
%   to GSP_MAKE for more informations. However, if the compilation is not
%   working on your computer, keep quiet, everything should still work and
%   most of the routine are implemented only in matlab.
%
%   Most likely, the first thing you would like to do is to create a graph.
%   To do so, you only need the adjacendy or the weight matrix W. Once
%   you have it, you can construct a graph using:
%
%           G = gsp_graph(W);
%
%   This function will create a full structure ready to be used with the
%   toolbox. To know a bit more about what is in this structure, you can
%   refer to the help of the function GSP_GRAPH_DEFAULT_PARAMETERS.
%
%   The GSPBox contains also a list of graph generators. To see a full list
%   of these graphs, type:
%
%           help graphs
%
%   For this demo, we will use the graph GSP_LOGO. You can load it
%   using:
%
%           G = gsp_logo
%
%   Here observe the attribute of the structure G. 
%
%    G.W*: Weight matrix 
%    G.A*: Adacency matrix 
%    G.N*: Number of nodes 
%    G.type*: Type of graph 
%    G.directed*: 1 if the graph is directed, 0 if not
%    G.lap_type*: Laplacian type 
%    G.d*: Degree vector 
%    G.Ne*: Number of edges
%    G.coords*: Coordinates of the vertices
%    G.plotting*: Plotting parameters
%
%   In the folder 'plotting', the GSPBox contains some plotting routine.
%   For instance, we can plot a graph using:
%
%           gsp_plot_graph(G);
%
%   Figure 1: GSP graph
%
%      This figure shows the result of the command 'gsp_plot_graph(G)'
%
%   Wonderful! Isn't it? Now, let us start to analyse this graph. To compute
%   graph Fourier transform or exact graph filtering, you need to
%   precompute the Fourier basis of the graph. This operation could be
%   relatively long since it involves a full diagonalization of the
%   Laplacian. Don't worry, you do not need to perform this operation to
%   filter signals on graph. The fourier basis is computed by:
%
%           G = gsp_compute_fourier_basis(G);
%
%   The function GSP_COMPUTE_FOURIER_BASIS add two new fields to the
%   structure G*:
%
%    G.U*: The eigenvectors of the Fourier basis
%    G.e*: The eigenvalues
%
%   The fourier eigenvectors does look like a sinusoide on the graph. Let's
%   plot the second and the third ones. (The first one is constant!):
%
%           gsp_plot_signal(G,G.U(:,2));
%           title('Second eigenvector')
%           subplot(212)
%           gsp_plot_signal(G,G.U(:,3));
%           title('Third eigenvector')
%
%   Figure 2: Eigenvectors
%
%
%
%   Now, we are going to show a basic filtering operation. Filters are usually
%   defined in the spectral domain. To define the following filter
%
%        h(x) = 1/(1+tau*x),
%
%   just write in Matlab:
%
%           tau = 1;
%           h = @(x) 1./(1+tau*x);
%
%   Hint: You can define filterbank using cell array!
%
%   Let's display this filter:
%
%           gsp_plot_filter(G,h);
%
%   Figure 3: Low pass filter $h$
%
%      The filter h is plotted along all the spectrum of the graph.
%      The black cross are the eigenvalues of the Laplacian. They are the
%      points where the continuous filter will be evaluated to create a
%      discrete filter.
%
%   To apply the filter to a given signal, you only need to run a single
%   function:
%
%           % Create a signal
%           f = zeros(G.N,1);
%           f(G.info.idx_g) = -1;
%           f(G.info.idx_s) = 1;
%           f(G.info.idx_p) = -0.5;
%           f = f + 0.3*randn(G.N,1);
%           % Remove the noise
%           f2 = gsp_filter(G,h,f);
%
%   gsp_filter is actually a shortcut to GSP_FILTER_ANALYSIS.
%   gsp_filter_analysis performs the analysis operator associated to a
%   filterbank. See the GSP_DEMO_WAVELET for more information.
%
%   Finnaly, we display the result of this low pass filtering on the graph:
%
%           figure;
%           subplot(211)
%           gsp_plot_signal(G,f);
%           title('Signal with noise')
%           subplot(212)
%           gsp_plot_signal(G,f2);
%           title('Signal denoised');
%
%   Figure 4: Result of filtering
%
%      The noise is largely removed thanks to the filter. However, some
%      energy is diffused between the letters. This is the typical
%      behaviour of a low pass filter.
%
%   Enjoy the GSPBOX !
