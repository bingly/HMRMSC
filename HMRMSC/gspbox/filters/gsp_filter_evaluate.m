function fd = gsp_filter_evaluate(filter, x)
%GSP_FILTER_EVALUATE Evaluate the filterbank
%   Usage: fd = gsp_filter_evaluate(filter, x)
%
%   Input parameters:
%       filter  : cell array of filter
%       x       : data
%   Output parameters:
%       fd      : response of the filters
%
%   This function apply all the filters in filter to the data x. Every
%   filter correspond to one column of the matrix fd.
