function [ bool ] = gsp_test_duality_coefficient( gcoeff,hcoeff,tol )
%GSP_TEST_DUALITY_COEFFICIENT Test if the coefficient are from dual filters
%   Usage:  bool = gsp_test_duality_coefficient( gcoeff,hcoeff );
%           bool = gsp_test_duality_coefficient( gcoeff,hcoeff,tol );
%
%   Input parameters:
%       gcoeff  : coefficient of the filter 1 (matrix N x M )
%       hcoeff  : coefficinet of the filter 2 (matrix N x M )
%       tol     : tolerance for the test (default 1e-5)
%
%   Ouput paramters:
%       bool    : boolean 
%
%   This function test if two discrete filterbanks are dual. Each filter is
%   a culumn in the matrix gcoeff or hcoeff. M is the number of
%   filters and N the number of coefficients (size of the graph signal).
